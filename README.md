Itinerary estimation using AFC and TOT data for metro passengers.

This code is a part of code for an published paper ‘I Can Board, but I’d Rather Wait: Active Boarding Delay Choice Behaviour Analysis Using Smart Card Data in Metro Systems’
Due to the difference in the computing environment, running time calculation method, and data, we cannot guarantee that the program is more efficient than previous research, the code is for algorithm reference only. If you want to use these codes, be prepared to spend some time understanding them. The naming is easy to understand, I hope it will help you. The codes come with no warranty; however, certain errors may remain. You can use the program for academic purposes. What I ask in return is that you reference my paper.

This script takes passengers from ChunXiLu(O = 8) to HuaiShuDian (D = 83) of Chengdu Metro as an example. All data can be found in ‘InitialData.mat’. Due to the confidentiality of the data, some data has been added with noise.
